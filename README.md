### This project demonstrates how to use the LMAX Disruptor for high performance data processing.  

This Java Spring Boot project processes input data from a configured inbound channel and generates output data into an outbound channel after configured pipeline processing.

**Technologies Involved:**
+ Spring boot.
+ Garbage collection telemetry.
+ Inbound and outbound disruptors.
+ Flux Reactive streams.
+ Jackson JSON library.
+ Pipeline processing.
+ Mongo DB write/read.
+ AMPS read/write.
+ Chronicle queue read/write.
+ WebSocket read/write.
+ Active MQ read/write.
+ File read/write.
+ KDB read/write.
+ HTTP read
+ Unit testing and Mockito.

**To-Dos:** 
* Protobuf
* Kafka
* Automated validation
* Runtime configuration
* More unit testing :-)
